<p>+==============================+</p>
<p>FTL is a great indie game in which the player controls a spaceship and flies across the universe while fleeing from a rebel fleet.</p>
<p>It's sort of like The Oregon Trail in space, with some RTS elements. I highly suggest you check it out.</p>
<p>As the player flies across the universe, they need to stop at stores to buy more fuel as well as weapons, crew members, etc.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I kept dying before I could pick up any of the really cool weapons.</p>
<p>So, I decided to target the in-game currency with Cheat Engine, to see if I could hack my way into infinite moneys.</p>
<p>This was actually fairly easy and is a great first target for anyone who wants to get started with Cheat Engine.</p>
<p>Below is a demo of the work-in-progress trainer:</p>

<p>I scripted with Lua in Cheat Engine to make a cheat table, and then a full standalone trainer.</p>
<p>The tl;dr is that I scanned for the memory address which matched the value of my scrap (currency) while I bought and sold things at the store, then I scanned for pointers to that address, then I disassembled that region in memory, and then I wrote a script to alter the &quot;mov&quot; assembly instruction which I dissassembled. This instruction was called any time my scrap changed, and so I guessed that maybe it was moving an updated balance into my player wallet. So instead of moving the correct value, I edited the instruction to read &quot;mov ...., (float) 99999&quot;. This causes my wallet to be maxed out any time I have any kind of encounter which might change the balance, including random encounters as well as interactions with the shop (buying / selling).</p>
<p>The great thing about Cheat Engine is that it's easy to extend this trainer in the future to add checkboxes for more cheats, which I'll probably do in the future.</p>
